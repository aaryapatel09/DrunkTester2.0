**Overview:**

DrunkTester 2.0 is an innovative web application developed to address the dangers of drunk driving, particularly among college students. By utilizing both facial recognition and audio recognition technology, DrunkTester 2.0 evaluates an individual's level of sobriety, helping users determine if they are fit to drive.

**Features:**

DrunkTester 2.0 includes two primary tests to detect sobriety:

**Facial Recognition Test:**

Trained from scratch using a dataset of both sober and intoxicated individuals, this test analyzes facial features to assess the user's sobriety.
Audio Recognition Test:

This feature analyzes audio input to detect slurred speech by examining spectrograms. I implemented the Levenshtein distance algorithm to assess the similarity between the user's speech and standard speech patterns, effectively identifying signs of intoxication.
